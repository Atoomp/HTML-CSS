	  <p>
	     In October 2018, four decades after the Halloween murders in the small 
		 town of Hattenfield, Illinois, two crime-documentary podcast partners 
		 Aaron Currie and Dinah Haynes came to Warren County. Smithlyn Nursing Home,
		 visiting Mike Myers, who has been detained there since the incident. 
		 They briefly visited Mike's attending doctor, Ranbir Sardin, 
		 and learned that Sardin had taken over the treatment and observation 
		 work from Mike's former doctor, Samuel Loomis. Before the nursing home
		 to another mental hospital, ask for any clues about his "motive for murder".</p>
